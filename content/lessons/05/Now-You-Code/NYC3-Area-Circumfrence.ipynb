Provide 3 advantages for programming a user function in your code like `CircleArea`  or `CircleCircumference`\n\nAnswer: It makes the program easier to understand. Instead of seeing a formula in our code we just see a function. It makes the program neater. We don't want messy code. Saves time if you want to do one of the formula again. Instead of rewriting the formula we could sinply use the function we created.\n\n2. If we want to guarantee our `CircleCircumference` function is 100% accurate, what is the minimum number of test cases must we provide in step 3?\n\nAnswer:3\n"

This should be a personal narrative, in your own voice, and cite specifics relevant to the activity as to help the grader understand how you arrived at the code you submitted. Things to consider touching upon: Elaborate on the process itself. Did your original problem analysis work as designed?  How many iterations did you go through before you arrived at the solution? Where did you struggle along the way and how did you overcome it? What did you learn from completing the assignment? What do you need to work on to get better? What was most valuable and least valuable about this exercise? Do you have any suggestions for improvements?\n\nTo make a good reflection, you should journal your thoughts, questions and comments while you complete the exercise.\n\nKeep your response to between 100 and 250 words.\n\n`--== Write Your Reflection Below Here ==--`\n\n"
