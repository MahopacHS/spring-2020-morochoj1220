These files contain raw email data, and in that data is a SPAM confidence number for each message:\n\n`X-DSPAM-Confidence:0.8475`\n\nOur goal will be to find each of these lines in the file, and extract the confidence number (In this case `0.8475`), with the end-goal of calculating the average SPAM Confidence of all the emails in the file. \n\n### Reading from the file\n\nLet's start with some code to read the lines of text from `CCL-mbox-tiny.txt`"
