Why or why not?\n\nAnswer: Yes, because it makes it easier to sort the quantity of names by putting them in a list. \n\n\n2. Find the `NYC-funnynames.txt` file in your `lessons/09` folder. Open the file and add the name `Euron Trouble` to the file, then save and close it. Re-run the program in step 4. Do you see the new name in the program output? Explain why or why not? \n\nAnswer: Yes, because a list can change. We can add things and delete things from  a list. Lists are mutable.\n"

This should be a personal narrative, in your own voice, and cite specifics relevant to the activity as to help the grader understand how you arrived at the code you submitted. Things to consider touching upon: Elaborate on the process itself. Did your original problem analysis work as designed?  How many iterations did you go through before you arrived at the solution? Where did you struggle along the way and how did you overcome it? What did you learn from completing the assignment? What do you need to work on to get better? What was most valuable and least valuable about this exercise? Do you have any suggestions for improvements?\n\nTo make a good reflection, you should journal your thoughts, questions and comments while you complete the exercise.\n\nKeep your response to between 100 and 250 words.\n\n`--== Write Your Reflection Below Here ==--`\n\n"
